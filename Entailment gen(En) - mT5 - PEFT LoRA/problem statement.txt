The task is to build a model capable of generating text that is a logical consequence (entailment) of a given base text (premise).

Given:

•	Training and validation samples (train.csv and val.csv) from the Textual Entailment Recognition for Russian dataset (TERR from RussianSuperGLUE). In the provided files, each base text (premise) is associated with a hypothesis and indicated whether it is a logical consequence (entailment) or not.
•	A set of random texts (test.csv).

Task:
Create a model that takes the base text as input and generates new text that is a logical consequence of the base. In some way, assess its quality using the provided data.
Generate 10 logically correct statements for each text in the file test.csv

Format of the results:

•	A Jupyter Notebook with the code for training the model, assessing its quality, and the text generation loop. It is desirable to make the code fully reproducible.
•	The test.csv file with an added field containing a logically correct statement for each text.
